PISA is a text search engine able to run on large-scale collections of documents. It allows researchers to experiment with state-of-the-art techniques, allowing an ideal environment for rapid development.

Some features of PISA are listed below:

* Written in C++ for performance
* Indexing, parsing & sharding capabilities
* Many index compression methods supported
* Many query processing algorithms supported
* Implementation of document reordering
* Free and open-source with permissive license
